              <p><b>3. The License</b><br><span>Renovai hereby grants the Company, and the Company accepts, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, terminable license to use the Licensed Software for the Company’s users, all subject to the terms of these GTC (the “License”). The term of the License shall be as set forth in the Principle Terms and the Commercial Proposal.</span><br><span>The License is personal to the Company and does not include a right to grant sub-licenses of the Licensed Software, nor does it include a right to make copies of the Licensed Software, nor to market, distribute or sell the Licensed Software to any third party.</span><br><span>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these GTC, the Company shall not, alone, through its users, affiliates or any third party (or allow its users, affiliates or any third party to): (a) modify the Licensed Software; (b) reverse compile, reverse assemble, reverse engineer or otherwise translate all or any portion of the Licensed Software; (c) pledge, rent, lease, share, distribute, sell or create derivative works of the Licensed Software; (d) use the Licensed Software on a time sharing, service bureau, application service provider (ASP), rental or other similar basis; (e) make copies of the Licensed Software, except as provided for in the License grant above; (e) remove, alter or deface (or attempt any of the foregoing) proprietary notices, labels or marks in the Licensed Software; (f) distribute any copy of the Licensed Software to any third party, including without limitation selling the Licensed Software in a secondhand market; (g) disclose any results of testing or benchmarking of the Licensed Software to any third Party; (h) deactivate, modify or impair the functioning of any disabling code in the Licensed Software; (i) circumvent or disable Renovai’s copyright protection mechanisms or license management mechanisms; (i) use the Licensed Software in violation of any applicable Law or to support any illegal activity; (j) use the Licensed Software to violate any rights of any third party; or (k) attempt any of the foregoing.

The Fees shall be net of all taxes unless explicitly agreed otherwise between Renovai and the Company.</span><br><span>Should Renovai be required to collect or pay any tax, other than the taxes related to its income, in connection with the License and/or the Services, then such taxes shall be borne and paid by the Company.</span><br><span>If the Company fails to make payment within the specified time, Renovai reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Services, by giving notice to the Company, until payment is received, and the Company shall have seven (7) days to provide payment.
