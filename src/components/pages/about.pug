									p Alon Gilady and Alon Chelben (aka "the Alonz") first met while studying Economics at Tel Aviv University. They realized that they had a shared interest in creating and developing projects from scratch and decided to become business partners. After graduating, they founded a 3D-visualization studio for interior designers, providing photo-realistic CGI renders of interior and exterior settings. This project was their gateway to the virtual design realm.
										p Based on their accumulated experience and their enhanced understanding of the      design process, coupled with growing consumer demand, they planned out the idea of creating a fully automated, AI-based stylist which could completely change the way people shop online and add in the required context for a confident purchase.

								.mb-6
									p Regardless of industry, consumers today are faced with an overwhelming array of choice while online shopping. The theory of "choice paralysis" is that the more options people have to choose from, the harder the decision becomes. It's just too hard to make up our minds. Finding the right path to a happy shopper heart and mind is tricky and complex especially when items are presented as individuals, lacking context.
